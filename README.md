This project allows users to generate their own fantasy card sets, complete with unique visuals (using font awesome), descriptions, and attributes. The cards are sorted by rarity and type, and you can control the themes using sliders.
The goal was to design a generator where users could create a fantasy card set with random attributes but still have some control over the card's appearance and characteristics through slider-based inputs. Think of this as a tool for generating cards similar to those in collectible card games (like Magic: The Gathering or Hearthstone).
